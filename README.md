# Stroke-Prediction---Machine-Learning
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a stroke based on clinical and demographic features (Age, BMI, Hypertension, etc.). The primary challenge of this dataset is the **High Class Imbalance** (only ~5% stroke cases), making standard accuracy a misleading metric.
